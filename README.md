This project consisted of analyzing a dataset of jobs and salaries in the data science field through sort, filter, cleaning data and 
finding unique values and  using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Using charts to visualize qualitative and quantitative data I was 
able to find out:

•	The number of employees in the country of United States,

•	If there were any missing values or misspellings in the dataset through a data cleaning process,

•	The number of employees and their salary by experience level,

•	A range for the number of employees who make between 50K and 300K,

•	An increase of the number of employees and their salaries as years passed by,

•	A correlation between salary in USD and other currencies.
